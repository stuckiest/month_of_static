            <h4 class="syncopate">Flower Power</h4>
            <p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia </p>
            <p> A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Flowers give rise to fruit and seeds. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen.</p>
            <p>In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to beautify their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food.</p>

            <h4 class="syncopate">Pollination</h4>
            <p>The primary purpose of a flower is reproduction. Since the flowers are the reproductive organs of plant, they mediate the joining of the sperm, contained within pollen, to the ovules â€” contained in the ovary. Pollination is the movement of pollen from the anthers to the stigma. The joining of the sperm to the ovules is called fertilization. Normally pollen is moved from one plant to another, but many plants are able to self pollinate. The fertilized ovules produce seeds that are the next generation. Sexual reproduction produces genetically unique offspring, allowing for adaptation. Flowers have specific designs which encourages the transfer of pollen from one plant to another of the same species. Many plants are dependent upon external factors for pollination, including: wind and animals, and especially insects. Even large animals such as birds, bats, and pygmy possums can be employed. The period of time during which this process can take place (the flower is fully expanded and functional) is called anthesis. The study of pollination by insects is called anthecology.</p>

            <h4 class="syncopate">Usage</h4>
            <p>In modern times people have sought ways to cultivate, buy, wear, or otherwise be around flowers and blooming plants, partly because of their agreeable appearance and smell.[citation needed] Around the world, people use flowers for a wide range of events and functions that, cumulatively, encompass one's lifetime:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>For new births or christenings</li>
              <li>As a corsage or boutonniere worn at social function or for holidays</li>
              <li>As tokens of love or esteem</li>
              <li>For wedding flowers for the bridal party, and for decorations for the hall</li>
              <li>As brightening decorations within the home</li>
              <li>As a gift of remembrance for bon voyage parties, welcome-home parties, and "thinking of you" gifts</li>
              <li>For funeral flowers and expressions of sympathy for the grieving</li>
              <li>For worshiping goddesses. In Hindu culture adherents commonly bring flowers as a gift to temples</li>
            </ul>
            <p>People therefore grow flowers around their homes, dedicate entire parts of their living space to flower gardens, pick wildflowers, or buy flowers from florists who depend on an entire network of commercial growers and shippers to support their trade.</p>
